# TODO
#
# We need to define what our scope for a hardened profile is.
# The previous hardened profile was specifically related to
# grsecurity and PaX, which are no longer freely available.
#
# grsecurity + PaX specific configurations now belong in the 'grsecurity' profile.
#
# Baseline: SSP, PIE, Stack-Clash-Protection, bind_now/relro and FORTIFY.
# retpolines?
# control-flow-integrity? (clang)
# safe-stack? (clang)
#
# TODO: Discuss way forward.
